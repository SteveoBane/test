What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The command 'git init' creates a git repository.
A hidden folder '.git' will be created which contains a lot of meta data 
on the repository (history, commit messages, diffs, etc... they must be stored somewhere... maybe even information as to what branch this is)


**************************************
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It functions as a buffer between the repository and the working directory.
You can have multiple changes in your working directory, which are not logically connected.

The staging area gives you the possibility of only adding logically fitting changes to it.
Once you commit only these changes will be part of the commit, thus everyone is happy.
